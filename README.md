### ABOUT ME

My name is Mia Escobar. I am currently a first-year, first-semester student majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at City College of San Francisco.

I am simultaneously learning C++ and Python! To further develop these skills, I am part of the internship preparatory program, Computing Talent Initative, and contributing to an open source experience through CodeDay Labs under the mentorship of Tanmay Pradhan. 

Excited to continuously improve and explore AI and Machine Learning!
